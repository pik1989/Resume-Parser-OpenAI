# Resume Parser App (Gen AI + Flask)

### Objective

Creating a resume parser app using Flask is a great way to help job seekers test the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendliness of their resumes. The app allows users to upload their resumes in PDF format, which are then parsed to extract various pieces of information such as full name, email ID, GitHub portfolio, LinkedIn ID, employment details, technical skills, and soft skills. The extracted information is then presented in JSON format, providing users with valuable insights into the effectiveness of their resumes.

To build such an app, you can leverage various tools and libraries, including Python, Flask, Pyresparser, pdfminer.six, docx2txt, and NLP (natural language processing) libraries such as nltk and spacy. These tools enable the extraction of essential information from resumes in PDF and DOCx formats, making the process automated and efficient.

The app's functionality aligns with the growing need for streamlined recruitment processes and the increasing reliance on technology to evaluate and process job applications. By providing users with a detailed analysis of their resumes, the app empowers job seekers to optimize their resumes for better visibility and compatibility with ATS.
